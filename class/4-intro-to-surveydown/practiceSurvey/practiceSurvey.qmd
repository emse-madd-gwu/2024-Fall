# surveydown stores data on a database that you define at https://supabase.com/
# To connect to a database to store the survey data, update this with details
# from your supabase account and database. For this demo, we set pause = TRUE
# which will ignore the other settings and won't attempt to connect to
# the database. See documentation for details at
# https://surveydown.org/store-data

# config setup #
################

# Use the sd_config() function to customize features in your survey, like
# logic to conditionally display questions or skip to pages based on responses
# to skip other questions in your survey. See documentation for details at
# https://surveydown.org/config

# Here I insert skip_if logic to skip to the end if the respondent chooses the
# blue pill, and also show_if logic to only show the favorite fruit question
# if the user doesn't choose "no" on the first question

config <- sd_config(
 # Add any configurations here
)

# The sd_server function initiates your survey - don't change this
