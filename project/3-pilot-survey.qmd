As a team, create a **pilot survey** - an initial draft of your final survey for preliminary testing. Your fellow classmates will all take your survey and provide feedback. The course instructor will also review and grade your survey and will provide written feedback. Follow the instructions below to prepare your pilot survey.

# 1. Get Organized

Download and unzip [this template](../templates/pilot-survey.zip) for your pilot survey. The folder contains the following files:

- `pilot_survey.Rproj`: An R Project file for staying organized.
- `make-choice-questions.R`: The code to generate the `choice_questions.csv` file (your survey design file...use the code you wrote in class for this).
- `choice_questions.csv`: The survey choice question design file.
- `p1-intro.qmd`: The code for creating part 1 of your survey, which should include a welcome page, content form, and eligibility questions for screening our ineligible respondents.
- `p2-choice-questions.qmd`: The code for creating part 2 of your survey, which should include your education content and randomized conjoint choice questions.
- `p3-other.qmd`: The code for creating part 3 of your survey, which should include any other questions (e.g. demographics) you wish to ask your survey respondents.
- `images`: A folder of images (if you're using any in your survey). This is just to make sure we have a copy. In general though your images should all be accessible from the internet (e.g. github.com, uploaded to a formr run, etc.).

# 2. Write your survey content

The files included in the zip file are just example content based on the [blog post](https://www.jhelvy.com/posts/2021-09-18-choice-based-conjoint-surveys-in-r-with-formr/) on building conjoint surveys in R. **This is just placeholder content - you need to replace it with your survey content**.

Follow these guidelines in inserting your content:

- You may directly copy and paste any content you wish from your [Survey Plan](https://madd.seas.gwu.edu/2024-Fall/project/2-survey-plan.html) assignment.
- In your `p2-choice-questions.qmd` file, you should include at least one example choice question (e.g. the first choice question for the first respondent) using your choice question design file (the `choice_questions.csv` file).
- Your code should **not** reference any local files - all files should be hosted online somewhere (e.g. github.com, uploaded to a formr run, etc.), and your code should use the urls to those locations. This includes your `choice_questions.csv` file as well as any images used in your survey.

> Be sure to render each file often - you should render each part to html files so you can preview that everything is displaying as expected.

# 3. Upload your content to formr.org

Using the class formr account:

1. Create a Google Sheet for each of your survey .qmd files. You may directly copy and edit from the example survey parts.
2. Upload each sheet as a separate Survey in formr, then create a Run linking the surveys together. Be sure to carefully edit the Run settings such that respondents are appropriately screened out as desired.
3. When you are confident that the Run is ready, turn the "volume" settings to the third setting ("People who have the link can access").

# 4. Attribution

Include a short description of the specific contributions of each team member for this report. If all members contributed equally, you can just put the single sentence "All members contributed equally".

Team members who do not make meaningful contributions to their projects will not receive the same grade as that of their team mates. If you are having any issues or disputes among team members, please contact Professor Helveston ASAP so we can find a resolution.

# 5. Submit

Render your `.qmd` files for each part of your survey, then create a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment and submit it on the corresponding assignment submission on Blackboard. **Only one person from your team should submit the report.**

# Grading Rubric

**`r maxPoints` Total Points**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
make_rubric(rubric)
```
